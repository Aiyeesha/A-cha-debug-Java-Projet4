# Hemebiotec application

# Context

The program I worked on is a trend analysis program. Its objective is to read a file composed of several symptoms (symptoms.txt) and to write a new one (result.out), listing the symptoms in alphabetical order as well as their number of occurrences.

# Objectives and Achievements

The objective was to debug an application, using existing code, by implementing a solution using the concept of object-oriented programming and that could be reusable in the long term.

# Execution

When the program is executed, you will find the output file (result.out) on your computer by following the following path: A-cha-debug-Java-Projet4\Results.out
